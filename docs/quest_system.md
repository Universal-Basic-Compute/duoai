# DUOAI Quest System

The DUOAI Quest System is a relationship-building framework that guides AI companions in developing meaningful connections with players through natural conversation.

## Overview

Unlike traditional game quests, DUOAI quests are invisible to users and focus on relationship development rather than task completion. The system uses a tiered progression model where completing quests in lower tiers unlocks more advanced relationship-building opportunities.

## Key Features

### Invisible Progression
- Quests are tracked behind the scenes without explicit user awareness
- Completion is detected through natural conversation analysis
- Users see the results through increasingly personalized interactions

### Relationship Journal
- Players can access a "Companion Journal" that frames completed quests as relationship milestones
- The journal presents discoveries as memories the AI has formed about the player
- Relationship status evolves from "New Acquaintance" to deeper connection levels

### Tiered Progression
- **Tier 1**: Initial Connection (Ice Breaker, Gaming Origin, Play Style Profiler)
- **Tier 2**: Deeper Connection (Gaming Memory, Hidden Gem, Gaming Frustration)
- **Tier 3**: Insight (Gaming Motivation, Genre Explorer, Skill Assessment)
- **Tier 4**: Relationship Building (Inside Joke, Trusted Advisor, Emotional Connection)
- **Tier 5**: Advanced Connection (Life Connection, Value Alignment, Creative Expression)

### Special Quests
- Breakthrough Moment: Help the player overcome a specific gaming challenge
- New Horizon: Successfully recommend a game the player enjoys
- Emotional Support: Provide comfort during a frustrating gaming moment
- Celebration: Genuinely celebrate a player's achievement

## Technical Implementation

### Quest Detection
- Periodic analysis of conversation history (every 10 messages)
- LLM-based verification of quest completion with confidence scoring
- Evidence collection for completed quests

### Adaptation Integration
- Completed quests inform the adaptation system
- Insights are incorporated into future system prompts
- Creates a virtuous cycle of increasingly personalized interactions

### User Interface
- Subtle notifications when relationship milestones are reached
- Journal interface showing the evolving relationship
- Relationship status indicator reflecting connection depth

## Design Philosophy

The quest system is designed to:
1. Create genuine connections through natural conversation
2. Avoid gamification of human-AI relationships
3. Provide structure for AI companions to learn about users
4. Frame relationship development as a shared journey
5. Celebrate moments of connection rather than data collection

## Implementation Notes

- Quests should never be explicitly mentioned to users
- AI companions should pursue quest objectives naturally
- The system should prioritize authentic connection over quest completion
- Completed quests should influence the AI's memory and personality adaptation
