Civ 7's default UI is
unfortunately underbaked.
Fraxis said it'll take the months to
completely overhaul it,
but you can make it 10 times
better today without waiting.
And it's all thanks to the power of mods.
Steam Workshop is a
simple way to manage mods.
Unfortunately, Civ 7 won't support it
until sometime after April.
That means for now, we have to manually
install mods, which can
be scary for some people.
Don't be intimidated though, it's not as
hard as you might think.
In this video, I'll walk you through the
process step by step,
as well as recommend
a few mods to check out.
Let's get started.
The first thing we need to do is
find a mod to install.
The best place to get them
are the CivFanatics forms.
Alternatively, Nexus Mods has some
available, and even has a mod manager
program, but there's
a tiny selection and
it requires an account.
I'm going to stick with CivFanatics for
this video, but if you
download a manual install
from Nexus Mods, the process to install
them after will be the same.
Go to CivFanatics.com, click on
"Downloads", then
click on Civ 7 Downloads.
I'll also include a direct link in the
description below the like
button if you prefer that.
There are categories on the left here, in
case you want to narrow it down.
There's also a rotating list of featured
mods at the top,
which include some of the
most popular ones.
You can use the filter button here to
filter and sort the list.
I like to sort by "Downloads" so that the
most popular and established ones
show at the top.
As an example for this video, I think it
makes sense to use the
most downloaded mod from
Sukritact, who was just hired
by Firaxis thanks to his mods.
When you click on a mod, you're greeted
with an overview of what it does.
Some mods give more info and images, while
others like this one give less.
In either case, it's always a good idea
to read the overview,
as it often includes
important info such as
compatibility with other mods.
Not all mods can be used together, so
avoid installing multiple
mods that affect one aspect
of the game, such as tooltips or the
production window, unless
they explicitly say they are
compatible with each other.
It's a good idea to read reviews and
check the discussion tab
as well, as they'll often
point out compatibility issues
or other bugs.
I've noticed multiple mods that provide
numbers that aren't always accurate.
These mods can still be useful, but it's
a good idea to keep those flaws in mind.
You have a higher risk of bugs when using
mods, especially when
you use a ton of them.
It's best to be picky and add them over
time, rather than
adding 10 or 20 all at once.
Avoid mods that are new and untested,
especially if anything
sounds unusual or sketchy, to
avoid installing anything malicious.
Patches can break mods or
cause them to be inaccurate too.
Between that and how new the game is,
it's a good idea to
regularly check them for updates.
I recommend creating a bookmarks folder
and save every mod you
use into that folder.
Occasionally open them all at once and
quickly check the last
update info on the right to
see if it's been updated
since you last checked.
If it has, check the update notes section
to see what's changed, then download and
install it.
Once you've downloaded a mod, you need to
extract it to a folder.
You can use whatever unzipping method you
prefer, but for the
purposes of demonstration,
I'm just going to right-click on it,
click Extract All, then click Extract.
You might end up with an extra duplicate
folder level, which you
don't want since it can
prevent the mod from loading.
To check, open the new folder and see if
there's another folder
named after the mod like you
see here, or if there are
other files and folders in it.
If you see the mod name again,
then just copy that folder.
If you see other folders and files like
I'm showing now, click
the up button to go up
one level and copy that folder.
Regardless of how you got to this folder,
go to the path bar at the
top, then type %localappdata%
and press enter.
This should take you to your local
appdata folder, which
should have a Firaxis Games
folder inside of it.
If you get an error, you can get there
the long way by clicking
on this PC, double-click
your C drive, then go to Users, your
username, then open Appdata.
If you don't see Appdata, click on View
at the top, click on
Show, then click Hidden
Items.
Finally, open the local folder to reach
your local Appdata folder.
Now open the Firaxis Games folder,
then Sid Meier's
Civilization VII, and finally, the
Mods folder.
Paste the mod you copied earlier into
this folder to install it.
To get here faster in the future, for
other mods or to install
updates, you might want
to pin it to Quick Access.
Just click the up arrow once, right click
on the Mods folder,
then click Pin to Quick
Access so it always shows on the left
side here, or pin it to
the start menu if you prefer.
Now you can just click on it to go to
that folder quickly.
Next, we need to verify the mod is
detected and working.
Launch Civ 7.
Then from the main menu,
click on additional content.
Then click on mods.
Find the mod you just installed, and make
sure that it shows as enabled.
From there, you'll want to make sure the
mod is working by
testing it, which will vary
depending on the mod you installed.
In this example, I see that Sukritact's
Simple UI Adjustments
is modifying these plot
tooltips.
So that part of the mod is working.
Now I'm going to suggest some mods,
starting with two that I
think are essential for all
Civ players.
I'll have links to all of these mods in
the description below the like button.
The first I've already touched on is
Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments.
It's focused on UI
quality of life changes.
The first two features are simple.
You can click on a settlement owned by
somebody else to start
diplomacy, and plot yield icons
are smaller on tiles that
aren't improved or worked yet.
It also makes many
improvements to tooltips.
It'll show the default
rural improvement.
All constructables show their icon.
Wonders get a special icon with a
description, and buildings
will show if they are damaged,
in progress, or ageless.
It has some other changes that aren't
shown in the overview,
but are in the update notes,
like an improved building placement panel
to help you make better build decisions.
The second mod is TCS
Improved Plot Tooltip.
TCS is short for The Crazy Scot,
the modder who makes it.
This mod is compatible with Sukritact's and
adds a ton of stuff
like showing current and
max specialist counts, district types,
and better natural wonder descriptions.
It does way too much stuff to
cover in just a short blurb.
Suffice to say, it's an essential Civ 7
mod that I recommend for everybody.
Those are the only mods that I've
extensively played with,
but there are other mods that
I've used a little bit or I'm about to
start using that I wanted to highlight.
First up is City Hall.
The main reason why I like it is for the
improvements to the construction panel.
It's much more compact
and readable than vanilla.
It also highlights repair items in the
list, so they stand out
and are less likely to get
ignored.
When in settlement view, it uses more
distinct colors to
differentiate between urban and
rural, and changes colors when placing a
unique district to make it easier to find
the other unique district to
complete the unique quarter.
It makes a number of other changes too.
I was tempted to put this in the
essentials section, but I
haven't played with it enough
yet to recommend it that strongly.
Enhanced Town Focus Info will tell you
how much of a bonus a Town
Specialization will give you,
making it easier to decide which one to
pick and when to pick it.
It's worth noting this is one
of the mods where the calculations aren't
always perfect,
specifically for urban centers.
Leonardfactory's policy yield previews
is similar to the last
one, except for policies
instead of towns.
It'll show bonuses on the policy cards
when you go to pick them,
so you have some numbers
to go off of.
The overview clearly states it's an
estimate though, and is
meant to help you better evaluate
the options available, rather
than making the choice for you.
Discovery Lens adds a map lens that
highlights discoveries
that haven't been collected.
These can be easy to miss or forget
about, but it
automatically activates whenever you
go to move your scout, making it easy.
Yet (not) Another Map Pack, or YnAMP for
short, adds larger map
sizes and new map generation
options.
The Continents++ map type aims to have
less blocky continents,
and it scales better with
the larger map sizes that the mod adds.
Some features are experimental and known
to be buggy, so read the overview to know
which options are considered
playable and stick with those.
There are tons of great mods out there!
