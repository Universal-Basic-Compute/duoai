    "description": "Watch my latest piano arrangement(cover) for Han China theme from Civilization 7! \n\n\"The Han was not the first of China's ancient dynasties, but was arguably its grandest.

With an army of shi dafu, scholar-bureaucrats, at home and an army of chariots, heavy infantry, and crossbows abroad, for four hundred years the Han held the Mandate of Heaven.\"\n\nComposed & Conducted by Geoff Knorr\nPerformed by Bei Bei Monter, Zhiming Shu, & Ashley Jarmack\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 *Suggestons* *for* *new* *videos:*\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSyUj_bUduuZ_8c7b44sq3bzoqyZbTLpbPUPQwBgTXQeOzDQ/viewform?usp=dialog\n\n\ud83d\udcb4 *Support* *the* *channel!*\n- Become a sponsor!
