# Civilization 7 Exploration Age Guide

## General Age Mechanics
- Exploration Age follows the Antiquity Age
- Focus on exploring new continents and finding treasure resources
- The age ends with a plague crisis event
- Anything not unlocked in the tech/civic trees by the end of the age will be lost

## Legacies
- Choose legacies based on your performance in the previous age
- Settlement limit increases are particularly valuable in this age
- When in doubt, take attribute points as they're versatile for any playstyle

## Capital Placement
- Having your capital on the coast is advantageous
- You can change your capital at the start of the age if needed

## Technology
- Key technologies to research:
  - Astronomy (unlocks first science building)
  - Cartography (allows civilian/support units to enter ocean terrain)
  - Education (needed for science victory path, increases specialist limit)
  - Shipbuilding (allows safe ocean travel, unlocks treasure fleets)
- Urban Planning unlocks the ability to stack specialists

## Civics
- Try to unlock all civics by the end of the age
  - Piety (unlocks religion)
  - Economics (unlocks trade routes)
  - Focus on civics that increase settlement limit (Mastery of Society, Mastery of Colonialism, Social Class, Sovereignty, Imperialism)
- Complete your civilization-specific civic tree for bonuses

## Units & Exploration
- Units from previous age can be useful, especially commanders
- Cogs are your starting naval units - build several for exploration
- Cogs take damage in open ocean until you research Shipbuilding
- Cogs can survive 5-6 tiles of open ocean before sinking
- Cogs can perform coastal raids on encampments and camps
- Heal damaged ships before continuing exploration
- Fleet commanders work like land commanders but for naval units
  - The "Order" promotion gives +5 combat strength to nearby units
  - The left promotion tree gives combat damage and splash damage

## Settlements
- Focus on settling distant lands rather than your home continent
- Use the continent lens to identify distant lands (purple arrow)
- Aim for 3 cities maximum, with at least one on distant lands
- Convert towns to cities when they reach 5 population and have improved resources
- You can buy settlers with gold in towns with 5+ population
- Keep towns on "Growing Town" focus initially, then switch to "Farming Town"
- Your settlement limit increases throughout the age - use all available slots

## Resources & Treasure Fleets
- Prioritize settling near "treasure resources" (creates treasure fleets)
- Build fishing keys to access sea resources
- Treasure fleets spawn from treasure resources and must be escorted to your homeland
- Each treasure fleet provides points toward the treasure victory condition
- You need 30 treasure points to win the treasure victory
- Check the resource menu to see how many turns until treasure fleets spawn

## Buildings & Overbuilding
- Most buildings from the previous age no longer provide benefits
- Exceptions are "Ageless" buildings (Roman Temple of Jupiter, Basilica) and warehouses (Granary)
- Bigger numbers generally equal bigger yields
- Don't build unique buildings on tiles where you've already placed something else

## Religion
- Build a temple to found a religion
- Missionaries have 3 charges and must convert urban and rural populations separately
- Spreading religion to other civilizations is more beneficial than keeping it in your own lands
- Look for founder beliefs that give yields from foreign civilizations following your religion
- Relic beliefs can generate relics which provide culture and happiness
- The Theology civic tree boosts religion significantly

## Government & Policies
- If unsure which government to choose, Feudal Monarchy gives 20% food which is always useful
- Suzerainty of city-states allows you to choose bonuses

## Specialists
- Education increases specialist limit, allowing two specialists on the same tile
- Stack specialists on tiles with the most yields for maximum benefit
- When urbanizing, you don't lose population - rural improvements are removed but can be rebuilt

## Combat
- Defending is easier than attacking
- One-way cliffs allow you to attack enemies who can't attack back
- Commanders can be targeted and killed - protect yours and target enemy commanders
- Plague can kill units, including commanders

## Plague Crisis
- Plague will appear toward the end of the age
- It makes citizens unhappy and damages tiles
- Use physicians (purchased with gold) to treat plague
- Plague can kill units standing in affected tiles
- Plague generates migrant population as it resolves
- Plague will eventually end regardless of your actions

## Economy
- Your economy grows significantly in this age
- Use excess gold to purchase buildings and save production for wonders
- Wonders provide stacking benefits and carry over to the next age

## Miscellaneous Tips
- If a tile is damaged by disasters, population is temporarily lost but returns when repaired
- When suzerain of a city-state, you can choose your bonus
- Escort treasure fleets with military ships for protection
- Alliances may force you into wars you didn't plan for
