# Civilization 7 Tips and Knowledge

## Starting the Game
- Leaders are permanent throughout the game and can be ranked up across multiple games
- You unlock "momentos" for leaders that can be assigned to any leader in future games
- You'll play as three different civilizations throughout a normal game (one per age)
- Default map size is small, and maps grow through the game
- Consider playing on quick speed and lower difficulty for your first game

## Early Exploration
- Scouts are more important than ever and considered a "no-brainer" first build
- Discoveries are powerful and the world is very varied
- Navigable rivers play a key role in future ages
- Resources like salt are extremely valuable

## City Growth and Management
- Cities grow by accumulating excess food, expanding to new tiles
- New tiles become "rural tiles" (farms, woodcutters, fisheries, etc.)
- Rural tiles instantly improve resources and their natural yields
- Food is king for growth, alongside production for building
- "Ageless" buildings (like Granary and Spit) carry benefits through ages and cannot be replaced
- Most buildings can be overbuilt except for ageless ones

## Urban Development
- Urban tiles add another layer of complexity
- You can build urban tiles over existing rural improvements or on blank tiles
- Adjacency bonuses are important when placing buildings
- Mountains, resources, rivers, and coastlines provide important adjacency bonuses
- You can usually place two buildings on one tile to form a "quarter"
- Unique quarters can be created by placing civilization-specific buildings on the same tile
- Don't place unique buildings on separate tiles - put them together

## Technology and Civics
- Tech tree unlocks innate bonuses for tiles (e.g., production on camps and woodcutters)
- Early technologies like animal husbandry, pottery, and sailing boost tiles
- Civics tree is the cultural technology tree
- Unique Civics tend to be very good, often unlocking unique buildings and wonders
- Don't ignore Mastery options - they provide great benefits

## Towns vs. Cities
- New settlements start as towns, not cities
- "Settlements" is the collective term for both cities and towns
- Towns can be specialized, but it's best to let them grow first before specializing
- Specializations often limit growth or change yield calculations
- Towns can be converted to cities by spending gold
- Building with gold allows instant construction and border expansion
- Expand aggressively as the AI is hungry for land

## Combat
- Commander units are a major change, able to gather nearby units
- First assault promotion and any promotion that improves movement and deployment are fundamental
- Commanders operate in three domains: land, sea, and sky
- Fortifications have changed significantly - walls can be built around any tile connected to city center
- Fortified tiles must be destroyed before capturing a city

## Diplomacy
- AI is very willing to fight you regardless of difficulty level
- Hover over leader emojis to see why relationships are positive or negative
- Influence is a new resource used to improve relationships
- Treaties and Endeavors (except denouncement) improve relationships
- Denouncing, stealing, and being caught will damage relationships
- Influence is also needed to woo independent settlements
- War support is crucial - positive war support reduces opponent's happiness and combat strength

## Age Progression
- Each age has Legacy paths with goals in culture, military, science, and economics
- Completing Legacy goals speeds up age progression and unlocks rewards
- Legacy options provide abilities for future ages
- Crises occur toward the end of every age
- Crisis policies must be assigned (often with negative effects)
- The Revolt crisis can cause you to lose a city if happiness is low
- Age transition shows rankings and rewards compared to other players

## Changing Civilizations Between Ages
- Pick a civilization with unique units or buildings that complement your strategy
- Choose yields you're already good at to achieve goals for the next age
- Your leader will unlock geographical choices
- Previous gameplay may unlock additional options

## Legacy Rewards
- How well you did in the previous age determines available rewards
- Generic options like attribute points for your leader are always available
- Moving your capital city is often a good idea, especially to powerful coastal cities
- Put extra points into non-specific benefits when possible

## Exploration Age
- New Legacy path options become available in each age
- Goals change to match new game features and mechanics
- Exploration Age focuses on making money and reaching distant lands
- Technologies like cartography and shipbuilding are important
- Only civilization-specific policies carry over between ages
- Towns need to be reconverted to cities in new ages
- Stay at or slightly above your settlement limit
- Avoid deep ocean tiles when exploring
- The "new world" is usually close and contains treasure resources
- Specialists can be placed on tiles to enhance yields without expanding

## Victory Mechanics
- In the final age, you build up legacies toward victory conditions
- The final age doesn't have a crisis like the first two ages
