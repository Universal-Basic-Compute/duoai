# Civilization 7 Knowledge and Tips

## Game Structure
- The game is divided into three distinct ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern Age.
- Each age has exclusive sets of historic civilizations to choose from.
- In each age, you can work toward "legacies" (culture, military, science/codex, economy) that provide bonuses.
- Completing legacies can trigger Golden Ages with additional perks.

## Leaders and Civilizations
- You can mix and match leaders and civilizations, though there are recommended pairings.
- Augustus (leader) abilities:
  - +2 production in capital for every town
  - Can purchase culture buildings in towns
  - +50% gold towards purchasing buildings in towns
- Roman Empire (civilization) abilities:
  - 12 Tables: +1 culture on districts in capital and city centers in towns
  - +30% production bonus towards constructing the Coliseum
  - Unique units: Legion and Legatus (unique Army Commander)
  - Unique quarter: The Forum
  - Unique buildings: Temple of Jupiter and Basilica

## Settlements and Districts
- Settlements start as towns and can be upgraded to cities.
- Your capital starts as a city with a palace (5 food, 5 production, 5 happiness).
- Cities don't work their base tile like in previous Civ games.
- City borders don't expand automatically with culture - they expand when you place rural districts.
- Two types of districts:
  - Urban districts: Hold buildings (max 2 per district)
  - Rural districts: Created when population works a tile

## Population and Resources
- Each population unit works a tile by creating a rural district.
- Rural districts are self-sustaining (don't cost food to maintain).
- When you place a rural district, it creates an improvement based on the terrain.
- Placing a rural district on a resource tile claims that resource.
- You can build urban districts over rural districts - the population returns to your city.
- Specialists (unlocked later) cost 2 food and 2 happiness to maintain.

## Military
- Army Commanders (like the Legatus) are centerpieces of your army.
- Commanders gain experience and level up, unlocking abilities.
- The Roman Legatus can spawn a new settlement for every 3 levels.
- Scouts have special abilities:
  - Lookout: Increases sight range and stays in place
  - Search: Temporarily increases sight range and reveals discoveries at twice the range

## Technology and Civics
- Technology and Civic trees include optional "Mastery" techs.
- Masteries aren't required for progression but provide special bonuses.
- Masteries often provide Codexes, which give +2 science per turn.
- Each civilization has unique civic options (Romans have Exercitus Romanus and Civis Romanus).

## Governments and Policies
- Governments provide options during celebrations (triggered by excess happiness).
- Each government offers two celebration bonuses to choose from.
- Social policies provide passive bonuses to your empire.

## Other Mechanics
- Happiness contributes to a celebration meter, triggering bonuses when full.
- Independent villages (like Husa) can be befriended with influence or conquered.
- Ruins (goody huts) provide bonuses when discovered.
- Leader attributes (like Militaristic) provide permanent bonuses throughout the game.
- Momentos are game setup options that provide special bonuses (like Imago Mundi for scout vision).
- War support is a resource used during conflicts.

## Strategic Tips
- As Rome, focus on building towns to maximize Augustus's production bonus.
- The ability to purchase culture buildings in towns is extremely valuable.
- Scout early to find ruins and independent villages.
- Consider building a town on the southern coast to access fish and dye resources.
- Infantry units are particularly strong for Rome with the Legion unique unit.
- Aim to complete the quest for a commander with three promotions.
