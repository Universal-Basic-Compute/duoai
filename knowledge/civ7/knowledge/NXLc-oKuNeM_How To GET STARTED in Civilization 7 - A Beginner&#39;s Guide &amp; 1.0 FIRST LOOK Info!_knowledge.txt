## Civilizations and Leaders
- Leaders are separate from civilizations, giving different bonuses

- Other leaders include Isabella (Persia), Harriet Tubman, Confucius (Han), Katherine the Great, and Benjamin Franklin
- Each civilization has unique buildings and bonuses
- Leaders and civilizations can change between ages (e.g., Rome can become other civilizations in later ages)

## Game Mechanics
- Cities start as towns and must be upgraded to cities
- There's a soft cap of 3 cities (can be exceeded)
- Resources include food, production, science, culture, gold, and influence
- Influence (10 per turn) can be used to befriend independent villages
- Independent villages can be befriended, conquered, or incorporated as new towns
- Relationships with other leaders can be adjusted using diplomatic points
- Crises occur at the end of eras/beginning of new ages (like Viking invasions)
- The UI shows reminders of actions you need to take before ending your turn
- The game recommends good settlement locations with color-coded areas (green is good, yellow is okay, red is poor)

## Military
- Military units can be "packed" together under a commander
- Commanders can be promoted with special abilities (like Quartermaster for +1 gold per packed unit)
- Fortifying units increases their defensive capabilities
- Hostile tribes appear on the map and will attack your units and settlements
- Naval units can travel on rivers and coastal waters

## Expansion and Development
- Focus on food, production, and science early
- Scouts are important for exploring the map and finding resources
- Building near mountains, rivers, and resources provides bonuses
- Expanding toward water provides access to fish and naval movement
- You can build farms, pastures, and other improvements on tiles
- Ruins and discoveries on the map can provide bonuses when explored

## Strategy Tips
- Think about your next age, not just your next turn
- Consider which victory type you're aiming for (Military, Cultural, Science, Economic)
- If going for military victory, consider hindering enemies pursuing science
- If going for economic victory, secure trade routes and resources
- Always maintain some military units for defense against hostile tribes
- Use the water to bypass hostile units, as they tend to stay inland
- Befriend independent villages for potential military allies
- Consider the terrain when settling - defensible positions near mountains and rivers are valuable

## Visual and Audio
- Each civilization has its own architectural style that changes as you progress
- Music changes based on the civilization you discover
- The map shows detailed terrain including mountains, rivers, and resources
- The game has beautiful visuals with animated units and detailed landscapes
