## Natural Wonders
- Redwood Forest provides 2 food, 2 production, and 2 happiness, plus culture and science on vegetation
- Double yields from natural wonders makes them extremely valuable for Isabella
- Prioritize settling near natural wonders for maximum benefit

## City Planning
- When settling, prioritize access to multiple resources (like gold, jade, silver, wool, etc.)
- Settle 1 tile away from natural wonders to maximize workable tiles
- Claim resource tiles early to prevent other civilizations from settling nearby
- Consider the loyalty implications when expanding - claim tiles strategically to prevent others from settling too close

## Exploration
- Build multiple scouts early (4+ is recommended) to discover natural wonders and tribal villages
- Send scouts in different directions to maximize map coverage
- Finding tribal villages (goody huts) provides valuable early game bonuses
- Discovering natural wonders as Isabella provides 300 gold each time

## City States
- Prioritize becoming Suzerain of city states for their bonuses
- Save diplomatic influence to compete for city states that others are investing in
- Use the diplomatic attribute point to reduce the cost of suzerainty
- City states can provide a buffer zone between you and aggressive civilizations

## Economy
- Use gold from natural wonder discoveries to buy important buildings like Altars

## Legacy Paths
- Ancient Wonders of the World and Science are critical Legacy paths to complete

## Wonders
- The Great Stele, Oracle, and Gate of All Nations are valuable early wonders
