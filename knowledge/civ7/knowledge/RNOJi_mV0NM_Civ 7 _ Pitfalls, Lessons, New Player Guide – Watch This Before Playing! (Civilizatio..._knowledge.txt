# Civilization 7 Tips and Knowledge Guide

## Starting Your First Game
- Play as Augustus with Rome in your first game - they're a neutral pairing that doesn't change fundamental game understanding
- Start in the Antiquity age
- Set difficulty to Governor, as the AI is much more powerful compared to previous editions
- Keep tutorials on
- Turn on all three lens options: Hex grid, resources, and yields
- Settle next to water

## Initial Setup and Units
- Your first settler is called a founder and creates your capital city
- First unit only costs one production - choose a Scout over a Warrior for exploration
- Build a second Scout after your first one
- Use the "search" button with Scouts (costs 1 movement) to reveal more of the map and locations of significance
- Scouts cannot attack but can safely move past hostile units

## Movement and Terrain
- Rough terrain (rainforests, rivers) ends your turn when entered but only costs 1 movement
- Movement system is similar to Civ 5

## Technology and Civics
- Research sailing, pottery, animal husbandry, and masonry early to boost regular tile improvements
- Rush writing to unlock libraries
- After writing, go for currency to unlock Specialists
- Focus on culture at the beginning of the game
- Research mysticism, discipline, and code of laws early as they unlock essential game aspects
- Research everything in your nation-specific Civic tree by the end of Antiquity age or lose it
- Bronze working is essential before going to war

## City Growth and Districts
- Every tile has only one improvement associated with it
- Only improved tiles give you yields
- When a city gains population, you can grow by making a rural district
- Urban districts must be placed next to other urban districts
- Don't replace rural districts with urban districts as you'll lose the improvement
- The city center starts with a palace which counts as a building
- Every urban district can have up to two buildings

## Resources and Improvements
- Gold and silver are the most powerful resources - prioritize settling near them
- Improved resources can be found in the resource allocation tab
- Resources can only be reallocated when you improve a resource
- Warehouse buildings (like Granary) improve tiles around them
- Ageless buildings should be built during the Antiquity age

## Settlements and Towns
- You start with a settlement limit of 3 - always max this out without exceeding it
- Settlers don't cost population to build
- Towns are different from cities - they remain "growing towns" until they hit 7 population
- Towns focus on food and have no production queue (production converts to gold)
- You can buy warehouse buildings in towns with gold
- At population 7, towns can be converted to cities
- Don't settle more than about 10 tiles away from existing settlements

## Military and Commanders
- Always maintain a standing army - villages/barbarians are very dangerous
- Commanders act like great generals with a range of one tile
- Military units don't gain experience - commanders do
- Keep commanders stacked with military units to protect them
- Use the "reinforce army" button to teleport commanders to troops
- Denounce civilizations before declaring war to avoid penalties
- Defending is easier than attacking - fortify when under attack
- Have about 2 troops for every settlement you own
- Garrison coastal cities with galleys to prevent pillaging

## Merchants and Trade
- Merchants must physically walk across the map to create trading posts
- Trading posts give you copies of all resources the target has improved
- Trading posts also create roads between settlements
- Make a merchant every 15-20 turns

## Social Policies and Government
- When unsure which government to pick, choose oligarchy
- Focus on policies that give food bonuses
- "Clan networks" social policy gives 2 food in all settlements - vital to have
- After unlocking currency, change policies to ones that benefit all settlements

## Specialists and Buildings
- Specialists are unlocked with currency tech
- Specialists consume happiness and food but provide significant bonuses
- Look for buildings with adjacency bonuses for specialists
- Libraries are essential for science victory

## Legacy Paths and Victory
- Four legacy paths: culture, military, science, and economic
- Science is easiest for beginners - requires 10 codices on display
- Economic victory requires 20 resources in settlements

## Crisis and Late Game
- Crisis begins about 70% through the age
- Choose the least bad option during crisis events
- Always build your civilization's favored wonder
- Try to have coastal settlements before entering the Exploration age

## General Tips
- Food is always valuable - focus on food-generating improvements and policies
- Keep settlements connected by roads
- When the AI offers a deal, the middle option usually costs nothing and gives benefits
- Watch for narrative events that give free codices or other bonuses
- Natural wonders have impressive yields - prioritize settling near them
- Campfires (goodie huts) provide benefits when discovered
