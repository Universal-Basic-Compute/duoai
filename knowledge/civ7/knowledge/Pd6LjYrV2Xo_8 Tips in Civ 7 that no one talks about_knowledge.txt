# Civilization 7 Tips & Tricks

## World Wonders
- Track available wonders by opening the city screen, clicking "View Hidden," and scrolling to the Wonders section
- This only shows wonders you can currently build in that specific city with available tiles
- Wonders will appear/disappear from this list based on whether you have appropriate tiles for placement

## Game Setup
- Save your game configuration using the "Save Config" button to avoid re-entering settings
- To "reroll" maps while keeping your leader/settings:
  1. Save your configuration
  2. Copy the current map seed
  3. Load your saved configuration
  4. Replace the map seed with your copied one

## Controls
- There is a "Next Action" button, but it's mislabeled
- Configure it in Options > Keyboard and Mouse > Configure
- Setting it to Mouse 6 (browser back/forward button) allows one-handed play

## Influence Management
- Don't spend influence too early
- Save influence to support agreements offered by other leaders
- Supporting agreements (rather than just accepting) builds stronger bonds
- Wait until you've met all leaders before sending out your own agreements
- You're limited in how many agreements you can send, but not how many you can accept

## Leader Progression
- Complete Legacy paths to level up your leader faster
- In game settings, change the age length to "Long" instead of "Standard"
- This allows you to complete more Legacy paths before advancing to the next age
- Try to complete multiple challenges simultaneously for efficiency
- Higher leader levels unlock powerful momentos (special abilities)

## Specialized Towns
- Maximize specialized town bonuses by ensuring citizens work relevant jobs
- Kick citizens off connector tiles by building structures on them
- This frees citizens to work more productive tiles that match your specialization
- Example: For a farming town, move citizens from non-farm tiles to farm tiles

## Settlement Expansion
- Always build more settlements (within reason)
- Each new settlement increases your overall resources
- Watch out for the settlement limit and happiness
- Forward settling may anger nearby civilizations
- Technologies that increase settlement limit:
  - Irrigation (increases to 4)
  - Entertainment civic (increases further)
  - Organized Military civic (increases further)
  - Some civilization-specific civics provide additional limits

## Movement Optimization
- Moving onto goody huts or certain terrain ends your turn regardless of remaining movement
- If you have extra movement points before reaching a goody hut, use them to search tiles
- Example: Move to within 2 tiles of a goody hut, use "search" action, then reach the hut next turn
