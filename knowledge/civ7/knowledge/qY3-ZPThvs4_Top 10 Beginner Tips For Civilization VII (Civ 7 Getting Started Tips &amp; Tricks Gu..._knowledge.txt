# Civilization 7 Beginner Tips

1. **Produce Multiple Scouts Early**
   - Make 2-3 scouts as your first units
   - Send them in different directions to uncover the map quickly
   - Understanding your map layout is crucial for planning

2. **Use In-Game Tutorials and Encyclopedia**
   - Enable in-game tutorials for popup explanations
   - Read the Civ 7 encyclopedia thoroughly through the game menu
   - Learning all mechanics is essential to avoid mistakes

3. **Don't Blindly Follow Advisor Recommendations**
   - You'll choose an advisor type at the start (Economic, Military, Scientific, or Cultural)
   - Use advisor recommendations as guidance, not strict rules
   - Make decisions based on your current needs and strategy

4. **Start Peacefully with Other Leaders**
   - Greet leaders peacefully in your first playthrough
   - Peaceful relations allow free border access, more trade routes, and resources
   - You can become hostile later if needed

5. **Expand Your Empire Quickly**
   - Produce settlers early to establish new settlements
   - Try to dominate the majority of your starting continent
   - Choose settlement locations with abundant resource tiles nearby

6. **Continuously Produce Military Units**
   - Always have some military production happening
   - Maintain at least 1-2 military units at every settlement
   - Aim for an army commander with full troops at each settlement eventually
   - Include naval units for coastal or river settlements

7. **Leave Towns as Towns Initially**
   - New settlements start as towns before they can be converted to cities
   - Towns can produce things immediately with gold instead of waiting turns
   - Towns can be specialized to increase resource yields
   - Convert to cities only after you've produced what you need

8. **Utilize Espionage Actions**
   - Use espionage to steal technology and government styles from other leaders
   - These actions cost influence but are worth the investment
   - Getting caught typically only results in diplomatic penalties

9. **Don't Worry About Water in the Antiquity Age**
   - You can't access open ocean tiles until the Exploration Age
   - Focus on uncovering land tiles first
   - Save naval exploration for after the Antiquity Age

10. **Keep Up with Your Legacy Path**
    - Your advisor choice determines your Legacy Path (like a main quest)
    - Complete Legacy Path objectives to make progress
    - Your progress is compared to other leaders at the end of each age
    - Try to advance further than AI leaders on your chosen path

11. **Additional Notes**
    - Maps in Civ 7 are randomized
    - Happiness level affects your civilization's stability
    - Different civilizations may have unique units (settlers might be called something different)
    - You can specialize towns to boost specific resources
