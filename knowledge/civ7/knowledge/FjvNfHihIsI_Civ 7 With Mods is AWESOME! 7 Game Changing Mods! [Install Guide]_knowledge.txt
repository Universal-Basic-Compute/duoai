# Civilization 7 Modding Guide: Knowledge and Tips

## Installing Mods
- Steam Workshop support won't be available until after April; manual installation is required for now
- Best sources for mods: CivFanatics forums and Nexus Mods (though Nexus has fewer options)
- Installation path: `%localappdata%\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VII\Mods`
- For faster future access, pin the Mods folder to Quick Access or Start menu
- After installation, verify mods are working by checking "Additional Content" â†’ "Mods" in the main menu

## Mod Management Tips
- Create a bookmarks folder for all your installed mods to easily check for updates
- Avoid installing multiple mods that affect the same aspect of the game unless explicitly compatible
- Add mods gradually rather than many at once to reduce risk of conflicts
- Read reviews and discussion tabs to identify potential issues or inaccuracies
- Game patches can break mods or cause them to become inaccurate
- Be cautious with new/untested mods to avoid potential malicious content
