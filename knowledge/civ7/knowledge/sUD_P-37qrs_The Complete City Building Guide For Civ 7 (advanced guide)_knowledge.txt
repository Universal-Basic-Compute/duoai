# Civilization 7: Complete Knowledge & Tips Guide

## Empire Planning
- Identify 5-6 good expansion locations early in the game.
- Prioritize settling near natural wonders immediately when you reach 5 population.
- When you discover neighbors, consider placing "blocker cities" to secure territory.
- Settle at least 4-5 tiles away from enemy borders to avoid diplomatic penalties.
- Avoid having your borders touch enemy borders as this creates negative diplomatic modifiers.
- Use scouts to block enemy settlers from reaching prime settlement locations.

## Defining Borders
- Use natural terrain as defensive borders (mountains, navigable rivers, volcanoes).
- Navigable rivers are excellent defensive barriers as units must embark to cross them.
- Don't spread yourself too thin - avoid settling far from your core territory.
- Consider the defensibility of potential settlements when expanding.
- Visualize your empire's natural borders before expanding.

## City Planning
- Maintain approximately a 1:1 town-to-city ratio.
- Cities should have high production potential.
- Towns should feed into nearby cities - they can't send food to distant cities.
- Farming towns are generally the best specialization for most situations.
- Coastal towns with fishing resources make excellent specialized food producers.
- Towns must be directly connected to cities to feed them (via roads or water).

## City Building
- Buildings fall into four main categories with different adjacency bonuses:
  1. Normal buildings (granary, fishing key, etc.) - no adjacency bonuses
  2. Food/Gold buildings - benefit from water adjacency (rivers, lakes, coast)
  3. Production/Science buildings - benefit from resource adjacency
  4. Happiness/Culture buildings - benefit from mountains and natural wonders

- Cluster buildings together to maximize adjacency bonuses.
- Your Palace (capital only) provides adjacency bonuses to all quarters around it.
- Two buildings on the same tile form a quarter.
- World wonders provide adjacency bonuses to everything placed next to them.
- Never split up unique quarter buildings - always keep them together.
- Warehouse buildings (granary, brickyard, etc.) cannot be replaced later.
- Consider limiting warehouse buildings to 1-2 per city since they can't be overbuilt.

## Specialists
- Specialists can only be placed on urban districts (not rural districts).
- Base specialist yields are 2 science and 2 culture.
- Specialists amplify adjacency bonuses by 0.5x.
- Specialists cause -2 happiness.
- Increase specialist limits through:
  - Researching Currency (first specialist)
  - Building Angkor Wat (+1 specialist limit)
  - Expansionist tree (+1 specialist limit but -1 settlement limit)
- Place specialists on tiles with high adjacency bonuses to maximize their value.

## Roads
- Roads form automatically between settlements within 11 tiles of each other.
- Roads connect to the closest settlement, which can sometimes cause issues.
- Use merchants to manually create road connections when needed.
- Food sent from towns follows roads to connected cities.
- Food can be intercepted by cities along the road network.
- Water connections can send food without roads.
- Check town details to see where food is being sent.

## Overbuilding
- When entering a new age, yields from previous age buildings are capped at 2 per yield.
- You can build new age buildings on top of old ones (overbuilding).
- You cannot overbuild on warehouse buildings (granary, saw pit, etc.) or unique districts.
- Avoid overbuilding on buildings that provide influence (a rare resource).
- Buildings with multiple yields can be more valuable to keep.
- Prioritize keeping production and science buildings over happiness buildings.
- Each building has maintenance costs (gold and/or happiness), so replacing inefficient buildings is beneficial.
- Different resources become available or unavailable in different ages, affecting adjacency bonuses.

## General Tips
- Managing relationships with AI is crucial in Civ 7 - they won't randomly declare war.
- To exceed settlement limits at age transitions, position multiple settlers to found towns on the last turn before the age changes.
- Specialists are lost when transitioning to a new age and must be reassigned.
- The Mayan civilization is particularly strong in the Antiquity age.
- Use trade ships to connect coastal settlements.
- Pantheons are lost when entering the Exploration age.
