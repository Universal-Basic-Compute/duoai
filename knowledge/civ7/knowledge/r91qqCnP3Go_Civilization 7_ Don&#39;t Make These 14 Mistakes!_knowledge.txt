# Civilization 7 Tips and Advice

## Starting the Game
- Begin by exploring the area around your first settlement.
- Use Scouts' special ability to temporarily gain extra vision and reveal Discovery Tiles at double distance.
- Locate rival civilizations and independent peoples early.
- Start claiming territory once your Capital reaches 5 population and you can train a settler.

## Settlement Management
- Monitor the settlement cap on the top banner to avoid happiness penalties.
- Increase settlement cap through Civic and Tech Tree unlocks and leader attributes.
- Place settlements near multiple resources - they can expand to cover tiles up to 3 tiles away.
- Resources either apply flat effects to your entire civilization or can be assigned to individual settlements.
- Resource bonuses stack, so duplicates are beneficial.
- Secure access to oceans on both east and west coasts when possible for exploration.
- Repair damaged district tiles using gold rather than production for efficiency.
- Purchase buildings with gold, especially for towns (only way to add buildings to them).
- Be strategic about building placement, especially for unique District types that require two unique buildings in the same district.

## Resources and Trade
- Claim distant resources like cocoa, sugar, tea, and spices to prevent rivals from getting them.
- These resources are especially vital for the Economics Legacy path.
- Build merchants to establish trade routes.
- Try to have a trade route with every friendly settlement in range.
- By default, you can have one trade route per civilization, but can spend influence to add more.

## Military and Combat
- Always have a Commander with your military units during combat to gain XP and promotions.
- Commanders can occupy the same tiles as your soldiers and affect nearby units.
- Units that can't stack into a commander are lost when the age progresses.
- Send reinforcements to commanders from distant settlements.
- Expand the unit's action bar (arrow on left) to access upgrade and heal options.
- Units have severe strength penalties while embarked (including on river tiles).
- Ships can travel inland on navigable rivers to help attack or defend territories.

## Independent Peoples
- Hover over hostile units to see which village they belong to.
- Options for dealing with independent peoples:
  1. Use influence to befriend them (takes several turns but grants bonuses)
  2. Eventually incorporate them into your empire with enough influence
  3. Disperse them militarily for a one-time reward

## Influence and Diplomacy
- Keep some influence saved for blocking denouncements or quickly converting independents.
- Monitor rivals' progress by hovering over your portrait in the top right.
- Consider military action against rivals who are getting ahead.

## Age Progression
- Track age progress on the trophy in the top left corner.
- At 75% completion, a universal crisis event triggers (plagues, revolts, etc.).
- Ages progress at different rates, speeding up as civilizations complete Legacy path Milestones.
- Golden Age rewards at the end of each Legacy track are the most valuable.
- Falling behind early can be overcome, but might require aggressive strategies.

## Other Important Tips
- Secure distant lands for the Economics Legacy path.
- If militarily behind, consider taking well-placed cities from rivals or eliminating weaker competitors.
- Avoid fighting everyone at once - be strategic about relationships.
