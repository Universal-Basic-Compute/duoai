# Civilization 7 Tips for Beginners

## Initial Setup
1. Click the spyglass icon above the minimap to open map display options
2. Enable the "yields" checkbox to see resource yields on map tiles
3. Use the "settler lens" to identify good settlement spots and tiles with freshwater access
4. Avoid building your first settlement near volcanoes or flood-prone rivers

## Early Build Order
1. Build a Scout as your first unit
2. Build a Granary next
3. Then build a military unit or another Scout (depending on map size and barbarian proximity)
4. Build a second Settler as soon as possible to establish a second city

## Scout Usage
1. Use the new "search" action with Scouts to reveal hidden treasures and enemy settlements
2. Move your Scout one tile, then press the surge button to maximize discovery
3. Note: There is no Auto-scouting option in Civilization 7 (unlike in Civilization 6)

## Research Priority
1. Research "mysticism" as your first Civic
2. This grants access to pantheons which provide important early-game buffs
3. The earlier you research mysticism, the better pantheon options you'll have available
4. Good pantheon buffs include 10% city growth and production bonuses

## Combat Mechanics
1. Use the new "focused fire" command with Commander military units
2. This increases combat strength for units within the Commander's range
3. Always use this command when attacking with units

## General Strategy
1. The beginning of the game is crucial, especially at higher difficulty levels
2. Limit settler movement to 1-3 tiles to find an optimal starting location
3. Expanding early with a second city helps with economics and research
4. Early expansion also limits your competitors' options
