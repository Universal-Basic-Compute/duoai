# Civilization 7 Tips & Knowledge

## Scout Units
- Scouts have 2 movement points like Warriors but possess special abilities
- "Lookout" ability: Increases sight range by 1 permanently when activated (costs remaining movement)
- "Search" ability: Increases sight range by 1 for one turn AND reveals all discoveries within twice that range
- Use Search to find goodie huts (coastal edifices) from far away
- Scouts are more valuable than they initially appear despite having the same movement as Warriors

## Army Commanders
- Can stack multiple units on the same tile
- Can deploy units with a single button
- Special combat abilities: "Coordinated Attack" (for melee) and "Focus Fire" (for ranged)
- These abilities give +2 combat strength to attacking units
- Can use these abilities even with just one unit to get the combat bonus
- Using these abilities consumes the Army Commander's movement points
- Can only use one of these abilities per turn

## Resources System
- Five different types of resources in the game (three shown in video)
- Empire resources: Stack up and apply bonuses to your entire empire
- City resources: Can only be assigned to cities
- Bonus resources: Can be assigned to towns or cities
- Resources stack (example: 3 horses give +6 combat strength to cavalry)
- Need to acquire new resources to unlock the ability to reassign existing ones

## Settlement Types
- Cities: Have production queues and can purchase buildings/units
- Towns: Convert excess production into gold, can only purchase buildings/units
- Towns have a "focus" that dictates how they use resources
- Towns can be converted into cities by spending gold
- "Settlement" is an umbrella term for cities, towns, and independent villages

## Influence Management
- Influence is a valuable resource that should be spent carefully
- Used for diplomatic options like research collaboration
- Used for befriending independents (costs 170 in Antiquity age, 340 in Exploration age)
- Critical for managing war support and war weariness
- Can spend influence to increase war support during conflicts
- Higher war support reduces combat penalties from war weariness
- War support affects happiness across your empire

## War Support System
- War support affects unit combat strength
- Low war support causes war weariness penalties to units (-2 combat strength)
- Can spend influence to increase your war support
- War support is measured in tokens compared to your opponent
- Higher war support improves happiness across your empire
