# Civilization 7: Knowledge, Advice, and Tips

## Starting Decisions
- Choose a leader that synergizes with your intended strategy (e.g., Benjamin Franklin for science and production buildings)
- Consider your Momentos carefully - they provide permanent bonuses (like extra social policy slots)
- Allocate Diplomat attribute points early to maximize their benefit throughout the game
- Scout first - always build scouts as your first units (3 Scout opening is recommended)

## Early Game Priorities
- Settle near fresh water (rivers, lakes, oases) to avoid happiness penalties
- Prioritize growth in early game - look for tiles with good food yields
- Research Mysticism first in most games to unlock Pantheons quickly
- Choose Oligarchy as your first government in most cases for production and food bonuses
- Grab culture from goody huts when possible to speed up civic development
- Aim to unlock your Pantheon as soon as possible

## Expansion Strategy
- If you have space for cities/towns, use it - every settlement under your limit is essentially free value
- Stay within your settlement limit when possible (shown at top of screen)
- Plan city locations based on fresh water, resources, and defensive positions
- Use settlers to create buffer cities between you and potentially aggressive neighbors
- Volcanoes are dangerous for urban districts - avoid building near them if possible
- Settle natural wonders when possible (like Redwood Forest)

## Resource Management
- Cotton provides production in your capital but converts to gold in other cities
- Move luxury resources to your capital for maximum benefit when possible
- Prioritize working high-yield tiles over low-yield ones
- Use urban districts to evict citizens from less valuable tiles
- Avoid purchasing buildings in your capital - save gold for satellite towns
- Purchase buildings in satellite towns to accelerate their development

## Diplomacy
- Don't immediately offer research collaborations when meeting new leaders
- Wait to see if they offer agreements first so you can support them for better relations
- Accept cultural exchanges and research collaborations when possible
- Maintain enough influence to accept diplomatic offers (14+ per turn is good)
- Be cautious about alliances - if you forcibly end turns, the game may auto-accept alliances
- Alliances can automatically pull you into wars

## Technology and Civics
- Prioritize technologies that unlock production buildings
- Masonry is important for monuments and production bonuses
- Mathematics should be belined for the Academy building (huge science boost)
- Irrigation provides a settlement limit increase
- Code of Laws gives access to merchants and oratory
- Entertainment and Organized Military both provide settlement limit increases

## Military and Independent People
- Scouts can't attack each other in Civ 7
- The Assault promotion tree is generally the best choice for military units
- Independent people (barbarians) can be befriended or conquered
- First leader to befriend an independent people gets control - it's hard to "snipe" them
- Independent people can flip allegiance unexpectedly
- Use military units to block potential enemy settler paths

## Buildings and Wonders
- Granaries provide bonuses to farms, pastures, plantations, and fishing boats
- Brickyards provide production and science
- The Altar provides influence which is hard to get in Civ 7
- Petra is powerful for desert cities
- Use the "View Hidden" button to see what wonders are available to build
- Trading for resources like Ivory can give production bonuses to wonders (20% for desert wonders)

## City Specialization
- Cities can specialize (like Farming Town) to send resources to your capital
- Specialization requires a road connection to work properly
- Farming towns send food to your capital
- Consider specialization once a city has secured its essential resources

## Miscellaneous Tips
- Use the search function with scouts to find goody huts and important features
- Turn on "longer eras" in game setup for a more balanced experience
- Codexes provide science and progress toward Science Victory
- Traders in Civ 7 must physically travel to their destination
- Happiness is generally less important than culture, science, and production
- God of the Sun is a strong Pantheon choice for immediate benefits
