# Civilization 7 Beginner Tips

## Exploration
1. Don't send Scouts wandering aimlessly into fog at the start
2. Scouts have a new ability that temporarily grants extra vision and reveals Discovery Tiles at double distance
3. Discovery Tiles trigger narrative events with two reward choices
4. Find rival civilizations early to plan your strategy

## Settlements
5. Start claiming territory once your Capital reaches 5 population
6. Watch your settlement cap to avoid happiness penalties that restrict growth and cause revolts
7. Increase settlement cap via Civic and Tech Tree unlocks and Leader attributes
8. Found settlements near multiple resources (settlements can expand up to 3 tiles away)
9. Resource bonuses stack, so duplicates are beneficial
10. Secure access to oceans on both east and west coasts when possible for exploration

## Independent Peoples (Villages)
11. Hover over enemy units to see which village they belong to
12. Use influence to befriend independent peoples for bonuses
13. Eventually incorporate friendly independent peoples into your empire
14. Alternatively, disperse them with military for one-time rewards

## Military
15. Always have commanders nearby during combat to gain XP and promotions
16. Train extra commanders to keep armies strong between ages
17. Use the "reinforce" option to send units to distant commanders
18. Expand unit action bars (arrow on left) for upgrade and heal options
19. Land units have severe strength penalties when embarked on ships or rivers
20. Ships can now travel further inland via navigable rivers

## Maintenance & Repairs
21. Repair damaged districts using gold (faster and more efficient than production)
22. Purchase units or buildings with gold to expand quickly
23. Towns can only add buildings through purchasing

## Districts & Buildings
24. Be careful with building placement, especially for unique district types
25. Placing unique buildings in wrong spots can lock you out of unique districts
26. No warning appears if you're about to lock yourself out of unique districts

## Influence & Diplomacy
27. Keep some influence saved for blocking denouncements or converting independents
28. Monitor rivals' progress by hovering over your portrait in top right
29. Establish trade routes with friendly settlements in range
30. You can have one trade route per civilization by default, spend influence for more

## Ages & Crises
31. Track age progress via the trophy in top left corner
32. Crisis events trigger when an age reaches 70% completion
33. Ages progress faster as civilizations complete Legacy path milestones
34. Golden Age rewards at the end of Legacy tracks are most valuable

## General Strategy
35. Don't neglect your military even if pursuing non-military victory paths
36. Consider taking cities from or eliminating rivals who get too far ahead
37. Economic Legacy path requires settlements on distant lands for special resources
38. Claim resources to prevent other civilizations from accessing them
