                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>DUOAI was born from a vision to revolutionize how we interact with technology. As an experienced technologist with a background in AI and Web3, I saw an opportunity to create an intelligent assistant that truly understands the context of what you're doing.</p>
                    <p>Founded by Nicolas Lester Reynolds, DUOAI represents the culmination of years of experience in artificial intelligence, software development, and product design. With previous successful projects in the technology space, I set out to build the digital assistant I always wished existed - one that could provide intelligent, contextual help exactly when needed.</p>
                    <p>What started as a concept for gaming assistance has evolved into a broader vision for Universal Basic Compute ($UBC) - making advanced AI assistance accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.</p>

                    <p>I believe that advanced computing assistance should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to provide Universal Basic Compute ($UBC) - intelligent AI assistance that adapts to each user's unique needs and context.</p>
                    <p>We're committed to:</p>
                    <ul>
