Build a Scout immediately on your first turn to explore the surrounding area. The green and yellow tiles suggest good potential for food and resources, so use your Scout to reveal nearby tiles, search for potential settlement locations, and discover any nearby goodie huts or independent villages. This will give you crucial early-game information about your starting continent and help you plan your next expansion moves strategically.
