Hello and welcome everyone. Lionheart here, and today I'm diving into Civilization VII for the very first time. I've had a little bit of a preview, a little bit of a dabble, but I'm going in fairly blind to this big thanks 2K and Firaxis for giving me early access and a key, uh, so I could check this out. We're gonna be starting a Benjamin Franklin, um, Civilization VII campaign. Uh, the aim is to obviously play it through until we win.
