Since you're playing as Benjamin Franklin with Rome in the Antiquity Age, leverage the Legion ability by training multiple infantry units early to gain +2 combat strength for each government tradition. Focus on building the Forum unique quarter to maximize culture and gold generation, and prioritize constructing the Basilica and Temple of Jupiter to boost your influence and happiness. Your strategy should blend Franklin's scientific bonuses with Rome's militaristic and cultural strengths, using the Legatus commander to quickly establish new settlements and expand your territory.
