Place the Granary in the dark green urban district tile to maximize its base yield and adjacency bonuses. By choosing the dark green tile, you'll ensure the Granary is built in an empty slot without replacing any existing rural improvements, which preserves your current food production while adding the +1 food bonus to farms, pastures, and plantations. This strategic placement will support your city's growth and resource management in the early Antiquity age.
