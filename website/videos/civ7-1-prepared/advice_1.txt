Since you're on the main menu and have selected Benjamin Franklin, focus on setting up a game that maximizes his science-focused potential. Choose a small or standard map size with continents or archipelago layout to give you room to expand scientifically. Set the game speed to "quick" to accelerate your research, and choose a difficulty level of Governor to learn the mechanics while still having a challenge. Consider enabling the "longer eras" option to give yourself more time to develop your civilization's scientific capabilities.
