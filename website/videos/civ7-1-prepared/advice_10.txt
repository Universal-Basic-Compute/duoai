Since you're playing as Benjamin Franklin with Rome in the Antiquity Age, set your difficulty to Governor to learn the game mechanics while still providing a challenge. Choose a small map size to ensure quick interactions with other civilizations and faster gameplay. Allocate your initial attribute points into the Diplomat tree to maximize research collaborations, and prioritize technologies like Masonry and Mathematics to leverage Franklin's +50% production bonus towards production buildings. Your early strategy should focus on rapid exploration, scientific development, and using Rome's Legion ability to establish a strong, expandable empire.
