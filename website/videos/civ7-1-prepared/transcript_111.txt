So we want to build this, uh, best place. Well, the one that gives the most bonuses would be there. I'm gonna go for it there because then we'll get one, two, three, four around it. Rip my warriors. But like someone was gonna get walloped. Either my archers or those warriors. These guys are coming in though, which is good, and they can actually finish them off. Next turn.
