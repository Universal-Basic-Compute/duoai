Choose the "+50% Influence towards Leaving Units from City-States" attribute. This will give you more diplomatic flexibility and help you manage independent settlements more effectively, potentially allowing you to befriend or manipulate city-states with less influence expenditure. The bonus synergizes well with your militaristic approach and provides a strategic advantage in diplomatic interactions during this stage of the game.
