Spend your influence to befriend the independent settlement, as this will provide you with a city-state under your suzerainty for 60 turns. This strategic move will give you additional resources, potential military support, and expand your diplomatic reach early in the game. The long-term benefits of having a friendly city-state far outweigh the immediate cost of influence, especially since you're playing as Rome and can leverage Augustus's unique abilities to maximize the settlement's potential.
