... these we're doing next at the start of the next stream and, uh, recording episode. I'll be streaming and recording more of this on Friday, so I'll probably try and have another episode out either on Friday or Saturday. Uh, lemme know what you thought of, uh, Civilization VII so far. If you've got any tips or advice, the things you've picked up, always greatly appreciated. I hope you've enjoyed this first episode. We'll be back with part two, three, and more in the coming days and weeks ahead. So until the next one, take care and ciao for now.
