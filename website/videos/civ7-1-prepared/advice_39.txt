Choose the "Leave the hunters" option to gain 50 gold. Since you mentioned not wanting to slow down your government unlocking progress by spending culture, the gold reward is more strategically valuable right now. The extra gold will help you purchase early buildings or settlers, and you'll still receive an archer unit for your military, giving you an immediate defensive and offensive capability without sacrificing your cultural development pace.
