Leverage Benjamin Franklin's scientific traits and Rome's unique abilities by prioritizing early scout production to explore quickly. Use your first three scouts to search and reveal map discoveries, focusing on finding fresh water, resources, and potential settlement locations. Your Legion ability gives +2 combat strength per government tradition, so train infantry units early to establish a strong defensive capability while expanding. Aim to build the Forum unique quarter in your first city to boost culture and gold generation, setting the foundation for a scientifically and culturally powerful Roman civilization under Franklin's leadership.
