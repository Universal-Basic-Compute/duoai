Immediately start constructing the Hanging Gardens wonder, as it provides +1 food on farms and a +10% growth rate in all cities, which perfectly aligns with your current low growth situation. The wonder requires placement adjacent to a river, which you already have, and will help accelerate your population growth from the current slow 25-turn pace to a much faster rate, giving you a significant early-game advantage.
