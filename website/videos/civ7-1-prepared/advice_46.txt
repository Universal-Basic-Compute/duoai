Choose the Scientific Dark Age policy to gain a technology boost every five turns, despite the 50% science penalty. This strategic choice will provide consistent technological progress and help you recover from falling behind in the Science legacy path. The periodic technology boosts can help you catch up and potentially unlock critical technologies that you might have missed, making this a calculated risk worth taking.
