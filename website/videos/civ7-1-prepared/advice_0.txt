Since you're playing as Benjamin Franklin and just starting out, immediately build two additional scouts to explore the map quickly. Franklin's science-focused abilities make early map knowledge crucial, and scouts can reveal valuable resources and potential settlement locations while keeping you safe from early-game threats. Use the "search" ability to maximize tile discovery and look for natural wonders or resource-rich areas that can boost your early development.
