Choose "Welcome the merchants" to gain the +10 production and +20 food bonus. This option provides immediate economic benefits that will accelerate your city's growth and development, which is more valuable than potentially losing military units by sending soldiers after raiders. The extra production will help you complete buildings like the sawpit faster, while the food bonus will boost your population growth, setting you up for stronger expansion in the early game.
