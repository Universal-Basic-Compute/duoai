Send a scout to explore the camp near the river, as it could provide valuable early-game resources or discoveries. The camp appears to be in a strategic location adjacent to the navigable river, and using your scout's "search" ability might reveal hidden bonuses or trigger a beneficial narrative event that could give you an early advantage in the game.
