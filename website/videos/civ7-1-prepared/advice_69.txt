Choose the Civis Romanus civic immediately, as it provides +1 influence for each adjacent culture control tile and unlocks the Basilica, a unique Roman gold building. This will boost your diplomatic potential and economic growth, especially since you're playing as the Romans. The Cursus Honorum bonus of gaining culture when training infantry units will also help accelerate your cultural development in the early game.
