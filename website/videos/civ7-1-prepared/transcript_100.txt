I think we'd like to go for the garden. We can, so that also on there it shows you, plus six shows you that you've got a tile available that can produce that which is this one here from all the adjacency bonuses. What, what gives us that? Each coastal terrain, each adjacent navigable river terrain, each adjacent wonder, so we get plus six there which is pretty good.
