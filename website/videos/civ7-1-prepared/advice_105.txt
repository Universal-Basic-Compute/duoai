Immediately settle the Flat Desert Oasis tile as your next city location, as it provides a wet tile with 1 food and 1 production, which is rare for a desert terrain. This strategic placement will give you access to a unique resource tile, help expand your borders, and provide a defensive position near the river, while also potentially unlocking adjacency bonuses for future urban districts.
