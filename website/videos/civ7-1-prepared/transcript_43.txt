Thanks, Gwendolyn. Nice. (door opens) Building your legacy. Civilizations are remembered for their accomplishments and the paths they take through history. Some spread their accomplishments across a wide range, while others are devoted to a single cause. Your advisors are at your service to guide you on the path of your choice. Like any great leader, you may change your mind at any time. Now choose where to focus the efforts of the Roman people: economic, military, cultural, or science.
