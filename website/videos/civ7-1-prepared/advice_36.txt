Immediately send your scout to interact with the independent camp to potentially gain the infantry combat strength bonus and explore the newly discovered iron resource. The bonus will be valuable for your Legion units, and exploring the camp could provide additional rewards or strategic information. Your scout's "search" ability will help you quickly uncover the full potential of this area while expanding your early-game knowledge of the map.
