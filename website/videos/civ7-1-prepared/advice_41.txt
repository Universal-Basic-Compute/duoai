Use your scout to interact with the Gungnai independent village, but save your influence for now. Instead, use the scout's "search" ability to reveal more information about the village and surrounding terrain. This will help you gather strategic intelligence about potential resources, terrain features, and the village's exact disposition before committing any diplomatic resources, allowing you to make a more informed decision about how to approach this potential ally or threat.
