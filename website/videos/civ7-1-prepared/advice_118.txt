Send your scout to search the tile with the blue water resource, as this will reveal potential strategic features and possibly uncover a goodie hut or discovery while expanding your map knowledge. The search ability will provide additional vision and potentially give you valuable early-game bonuses without risking your scout's safety, and the blue resource tile looks promising for future settlement or resource exploitation.
