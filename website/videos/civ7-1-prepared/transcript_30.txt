Many argue that their way of life is no longer sustainable. Find place for the cattle herders to settle, spend one turn of happiness, gain one population to the nearest settlement or leave the nomads be. I would quite like to have more pops please early on. Boom. No, no longer nomadic, the cattle herders have begun to adjust to their new lives. Nice. And I can now grow my city and grab the, um, kaolin.
