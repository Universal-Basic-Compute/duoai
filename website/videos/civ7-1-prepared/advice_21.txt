Build a Scout immediately to explore the diverse terrain around Roma. Your starting location has multiple terrain types including forests, grasslands, and water, which suggests rich exploration potential. Use the Scout's "search" ability to reveal hidden discoveries and potential settlement locations, focusing on finding fresh water sources and resource-rich tiles that can support future Roman expansion.
