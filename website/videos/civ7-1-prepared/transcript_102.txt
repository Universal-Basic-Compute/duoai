Get back to help out, please. Choose a celebration. We love the council day (laughs) said no one ever. Um, oligarchy or government grants you the choice between these effects during celebration. Choose one bonus for the next ten turns. Food for ten turns, plus 20%, or plus 30% production towards constructing buildings for ten turns. Hmm. Choices, choices, choices. I mean, I've got nine, nine pops, haven't I? And we're getting another one in eight turns.
