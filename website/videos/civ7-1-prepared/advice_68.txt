Choose the Civis Romanus civic immediately, as it will unlock the Basilica District and provide +4 gold and +1 influence for each adjacent culture control tile. This strategic choice will boost your economic and diplomatic potential early in the game, especially since you're playing as the Roman Empire with Benjamin Franklin. The additional influence and gold will help you accelerate your civilization's development and potentially improve relationships with other leaders.
