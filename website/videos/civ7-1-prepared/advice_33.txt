Send your scout to explore the Rough Tundra region, as it appears to be an unclaimed area with potential resources and discoveries. By exploring this tile, you'll gain valuable information about the surrounding terrain, possible independent settlements, and strategic opportunities for future expansion. The scout's "search" ability will help you quickly uncover hidden features and maximize your early-game information gathering.
