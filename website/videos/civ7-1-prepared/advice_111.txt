Position your archers to finish off the hostile warriors on the coastal tile, ensuring you protect your city and prevent potential damage. By eliminating this threat immediately, you'll secure your borders and prevent any potential surprise attacks that could disrupt your early game development. The coastal positioning of your archers will give you a defensive advantage while allowing you to complete the combat and clear the tile for future expansion.
