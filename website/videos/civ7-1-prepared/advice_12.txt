Since you're loading into a game as Benjamin Franklin of Rome, immediately build three scouts to explore your starting area thoroughly. Use the "search" ability on your scouts to reveal hidden discoveries and potential settlement locations, prioritizing tiles near fresh water and resources. Your early focus should be on rapid exploration and identifying prime locations for your first few settlements, leveraging Rome's Legion ability to quickly establish and defend new territories.
