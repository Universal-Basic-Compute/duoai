Um, but obviously in that, civilizations with their leaders were all attached and combined. Now they're separate and also there's several ages that you go through across the course of a game of Civilization VII, and each time you go through into a new age, you get to choose a new civ to adapt into, which is quite interesting. So this is probably one of the- I guess, the biggest changes to the civ formula maybe there's ever been.
