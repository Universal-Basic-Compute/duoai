Send your scout to search the Flat Grassland Forest tile with the hostile warrior village, as this will reveal potential resources or strategic terrain features without risking combat. The search ability will provide additional vision and potentially uncover discoveries that can inform your next expansion or military strategy, all while keeping your scout safe from the hostile village.
