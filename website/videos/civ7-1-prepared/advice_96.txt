Immediately purchase a warrior to defend your capital city, as you have multiple hostile warriors from an independent village approaching your territory. Position the new warrior between the enemy units and your city center to create a defensive buffer and prevent potential pillaging or capture of your settlement. This will buy you time to potentially negotiate with the independent village or prepare a more comprehensive military response.
