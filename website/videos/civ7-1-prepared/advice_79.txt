Move your scout to explore the wreckage tile you mentioned, as it likely contains a discovery event that can provide valuable early-game bonuses like extra resources, culture, or technology. The incense resource with its +10% science bonus looks promising, so position your scout to potentially claim or investigate that tile next after checking out the wreckage. This strategic exploration will help you uncover hidden advantages and expand your understanding of the map's potential resources.
