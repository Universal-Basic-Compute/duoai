Next step. Objective, research writings, first step. Yep, cool. Um, is the Founders Edition worthy? Uh, I honestly don't know 'cause this is literally, like, my first, like, proper bit of gameplay with it. First, like, 25 minutes so far. I'm enjoying it, but yeah, I'm probably not gonna be in a, in a position to be able to give a solid recommendation or not, just based off this limited playtime that I've had so far.
