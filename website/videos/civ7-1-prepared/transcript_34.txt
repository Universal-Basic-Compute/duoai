Of sort of Civ Five and Civ Six together. Oh, what have I got over here? Oh, I've got a leader tribute to spend. Plus one gold per age on the palace and city halls. Okay, I'll spend that. Your first leader tribute point, uh, these let you customize your leaders for your play style. You can choose your first tribute. Click the icon, your leader's portrait. Nice. Just done that. Lovely.
