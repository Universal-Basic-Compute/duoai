Move your scout to the luxurious encampment and use the "search" ability to reveal its potential rewards. The camels resource you mentioned could provide a significant boost to your city's resource allocation, and using the scout's search will help you uncover this opportunity without spending additional movement or influence. This strategic exploration will help you maximize your early-game resource potential and potentially unlock valuable bonuses for your civilization.
