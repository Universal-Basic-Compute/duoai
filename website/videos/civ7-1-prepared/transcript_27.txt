Down here, turning that into me granary. We can also pop it in the center, but I kind of wanna keep that one clear. I'm not sure what for, but- (clears throat) I should say, complete Civ Seven noob. Largely complete Civ noob as well. I was all right at Civ Six. Wasn't great. Hopefully I'll get better. Population. Thanks to the amount of food that the city has generated, it has grown in population.
