A powerful addition to the military. They could be convinced. Find common ground with the hunters. Plus one archer unit to Rome. Uh, spend three turns of culture or leave the hunters, uh, and gain 50 gold. I'm gonna say, yeah, gimme that, gimme those hunters. I don't wanna gain any culture, which actually I haven't hit my level for unlocking governments, so that's gonna slow me down a little bit. (clicks mouse) That's pretty good. We've now got an archery unit early on.
